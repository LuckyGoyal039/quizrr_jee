              Can I attempt a test any time or is it mandatory to attempt it on
              the particular date & time mentioned in the schedule?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              The dates listed in the test schedule show when the tests will be
              uploaded. This means you can start attempting them from those
              dates. You don&apos;t have to take the tests on those exact days. Once
              they&apos;re uploaded and ready, you can take the tests whenever you
              want until the test series expires. Note: 1. The previously
              uploaded tests can also be attempted. 2. You will get analysis and
              ranking irrespective of the date on which you attempt the test.{" "}
